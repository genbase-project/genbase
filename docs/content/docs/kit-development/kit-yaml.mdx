# kit.yaml Reference <FileTextIcon className="inline-block h-5 w-5 align-text-bottom" />

The `kit.yaml` file is the manifest for your Genbase Kit. It's a YAML file located at the root of your Kit's directory structure that defines metadata, configuration, capabilities, and resources. Genbase parses this file to understand how to install, configure, and utilize your Kit.

## Top-Level Fields

These fields define the fundamental identity and characteristics of the Kit.

```yaml
# --- Required Metadata ---
docVersion: v1           # Specification version (currently only "v1" is supported)

## Detailed Sections

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Metadata & Dependencies">
    *   `docVersion` (Required, String): Must be `"v1"`. Specifies the version of the `kit.yaml` specification itself.
    *   `id` (Required, String): A unique identifier for this Kit within the `owner`'s namespace. Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens (kebab-case). Example: `postgres-manager`, `web-scraper-basic`.
    *   `version` (Required, String): The [Semantic Version](https://semver.org/) (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) of this specific Kit release. Example: `1.2.3`.
    *   `name` (Required, String): A human-friendly name displayed in the UI. Example: "PostgreSQL Administrator".
    *   `owner` (Required, String): The namespace for the Kit, usually your organization or username. Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. Example: `genbase`, `mycompany`.
    *   `description` (Optional, String): A brief, one-sentence description of the Kit's purpose.
    *   `dependencies` (Optional, List of Strings): A list of Python package names required by the Kit's **[Tools](/kit-development/tools)**. These will be installed via `pip` in the Tool execution container. Format should match `requirements.txt` entries. Example: `['requests', 'psycopg2-binary>=2.9']`.
    *   `environment` (Optional, List of Objects): Defines environment variables expected by the Kit's Tools or Agents. Users will be prompted to provide values when creating a Module from this Kit.
        *   `name` (Required, String): The environment variable name (e.g., `API_KEY`).
        *   `description` (Required, String): Explanation of what the variable is for.
        *   `required` (Optional, Boolean): If `true`, the user *must* provide a value when creating a module. Default: `false`.
        *   `default` (Optional, String): A default value if the user doesn't provide one (only applies if `required` is `false`).
    *   `image` (Optional, String): Specifies the base Docker image used for running the Kit's **[Tools](/concepts/tools-execution)**. Defaults to `python:3.11-slim`. Choose an image that meets your Tool's runtime needs.
    *   `ports` (Optional, List of Objects): Defines network ports that should be mapped from the Tool execution container to the host machine.
        *   `name` (Required, String): A logical name for the port (e.g., `API`, `DEBUGGER`). This name will be used to create an environment variable `PORT_{NAME}` inside the container, holding the *host* port number it was mapped to (e.g., `PORT_API=34567`).
        *   `port` (Required, Integer): The port number *inside* the container that your Tool listens on. Genbase will find an available port on the host and map it to this container port.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agents">
    Defines custom **[Agent](/concepts/profiles-agents)** classes implemented within this Kit's `agents/` directory. If you only use built-in agents (like `TaskerAgent`), this section can be omitted.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Workspace">
    Defines the initial contents of the Module's **[Workspace](/concepts/workspace-resources)** repository and files to ignore.

      ignore:         # Optional: List of gitignore patterns for the module repo
        - "*.log"
        - ".cache/"
        - "temp_*"

        *   `path` (Required, String): The path to the file or directory relative to the Kit's `workspace/` folder.
        *   `description` (Optional, String): A description of the file/directory's purpose.
    *   `ignore` (Optional, List of Strings): A list of patterns (following `.gitignore` syntax) to be added to the Module's `.gitignore` file upon creation. Helps keep the Module's repository clean.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

<Callout title="Validation">
Genbase validates the `kit.yaml` file when a Kit is installed or uploaded. Ensure your YAML is well-formed and adheres to this specification. Referencing non-existent files (in `instructions`, `workspace.files`, `tools`) will likely cause errors during Module creation or Tool execution.
