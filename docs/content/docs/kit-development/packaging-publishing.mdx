# Packaging and Publishing Kits

After developing your Kit, you need to package it correctly before you can install it locally or share it by publishing it to a Kit Registry.

## 1. Packaging Your Kit <ArchiveIcon className="inline-block h-5 w-5 align-text-bottom" />

Genbase expects Kits to be distributed as **gzipped tar archives (`.tar.gz`)**. This archive must contain all your Kit's files and directories directly at the root of the archive (not nested inside an extra folder).

<Steps>

### Create the Archive

Ensure all your Kit's files (`kit.yaml`, `tools/`, `workspace/`, `requirements.txt`, etc.) are in a single root directory (e.g., `my-awesome-kit`). Open your terminal, navigate to the directory *containing* your Kit's root folder, and run the `tar` command:

```bash
# Example: Kit files are in './my-awesome-kit'
# Output filename format suggestion: owner-kit_id-version.tar.gz

tar czvf your_owner-my_awesome_kit-1.0.0.tar.gz -C my-awesome-kit .
```

*   `c`: Create archive.
*   `z`: Use gzip compression.
*   `v`: Verbose (optional).
*   `f <filename>`: Specify the output archive name.
*   `-C <directory>`: **Crucial:** Change to this directory (`my-awesome-kit` in the example) before adding files.
*   `.`: Add all contents of the current directory (which `-C` changed to) to the archive root.

### Verify the Structure (Optional)

Check the contents to ensure files are at the root:

```bash
tar tzvf your_owner-my_awesome_kit-1.0.0.tar.gz
```

You should see entries like `./kit.yaml`, `./tools/some_tool.py`, etc., *without* a leading directory like `my-awesome-kit/`.

</Steps>

## 2. Local Installation / Upload

You can test your packaged Kit by installing it directly into your local Genbase Studio:

1.  Go to the **Registry** section (<PackageSearchIcon className="inline-block h-3 w-3" />).
2.  Find and click the **"Upload Kit"** button.
3.  Select your created `.tar.gz` file.

Genbase will validate and install the Kit locally.

## 3. Publishing to a Registry <UploadCloudIcon className="inline-block h-5 w-5 align-text-bottom" />

To share your Kit with others, publish it to a Kit Registry.

### Public Registry (`registry.genbase.io`)

The default public registry offers a manual upload process:

1.  **Navigate:** Go to [`https://registry.genbase.io`](https://registry.genbase.io) in your web browser.
2.  **Account:** Register for an account or Log in.
    <Callout title="Owner Matching" intent="warn" icon={<UserCheckIcon />}>
    Your username on `registry.genbase.io` **must** exactly match the `owner` field specified in your Kit's `kit.yaml` file. Ensure they are identical (case-sensitive).
    </Callout>
3.  **Publish Page:** Navigate to the `/publish` page on the registry website.
4.  **Upload:** Use the interface provided on the `/publish` page to select and upload your packaged `.tar.gz` Kit file.
5.  **Verification:** The registry will likely perform validations on your `kit.yaml` and package structure. Follow any instructions provided by the registry interface.

<Callout title="Programmatic Publishing (Future)">
Currently, publishing to `registry.genbase.io` is a manual web upload process. Programmatic publishing via API keys might become available in the future. Check the registry's documentation for updates.

### Private or Alternative Registries

If you are using a different registry (e.g., self-hosted or third-party):

*   Ensure your Genbase Engine's `REGISTRY_URL` environment variable points to the correct registry base URL.
*   Follow the specific publishing procedures provided by that registry's documentation. The registry must expose an API compatible with Genbase's `KitService` for discovery and downloading.

Publishing your Kit makes your specialized AI capabilities available for others to discover, install, and integrate into their own Genbase projects.
