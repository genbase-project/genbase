# Quick Start Guide

This guide will walk you through the fastest way to get a local Genbase instance running using Docker and Docker Compose. This is the recommended method for most users trying out Genbase.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Docker:** [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
*   **Docker Compose:** Usually included with Docker Desktop. Verify with `docker-compose --version`.
*   **Git:** [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) (for cloning the repository).
*   A **Text Editor:** For editing configuration files.

## Setup and Run

<Steps>

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and clone the Genbase monorepo:

```bash
git clone <your-genbase-repo-url> # Replace with the actual repository URL
cd genbase # Navigate into the cloned directory
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Genbase uses `.env` files for configuration. Templates are provided, but you **must** create and edit the actual files.

*   **Root `.env`:** Controls database credentials, admin user, and potentially shared settings.
    ```bash
    cp .env.template .env
    ```
    <Callout title="Important: Edit .env" intent="warn">
      Open the newly created `.env` file in your text editor. You **must** change at least the following:
      *   `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Set a strong password for the database.
      *   `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Set a strong password for the initial superuser account (`ADMIN_USERNAME` is usually 'admin').
      *   LLM Keys: Add **at least one** API key (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) for the AI models to function.
      *   `AUTH_SECRET`: Generate a strong, unique secret key (e.g., using `openssl rand -hex 32`) for securing authentication tokens.
    </Callout>

*   **Engine & Studio `.env` (Optional but Recommended):** Docker Compose will primarily use the root `.env`, but local scripts might use these. Create them from templates if they exist:
    ```bash
    # In the repository root directory
    [ -f engine/.env.template ] && cp engine/.env.template engine/.env
    [ -f studio/.env.template ] && cp studio/.env.template studio/.env
    ```
    *Note: The `VITE_ENGINE_URL` in `studio/.env` should typically remain `http://localhost:8000` for the default Docker setup.*

### 3. Build Docker Images (Optional)

While `docker-compose up` will build images if they don't exist, you can build them explicitly first:

```bash {{ "title": "Terminal" }}
./scripts/docker-run.sh build
```

### 4. Start Services

Use the provided script to start all services (Database, Engine, Studio) in detached mode:

```bash {{ "title": "Terminal" }}
./scripts/docker-run.sh up
```

This command will:
*   Pull necessary base images.
*   Build the Engine and Studio images (if not already built).
*   Create and start the containers defined in `docker/docker-compose.yml`.
*   Set up the necessary network and volumes.

### 5. Verify Services

Wait a minute or two for the services to initialize.

*   **Studio (Frontend):** Open your web browser and navigate to [`http://localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173). You should see the Genbase Studio login page.
*   **Engine (Backend API):** You can check the API documentation (Swagger UI) at [`http://localhost:8000/docs`](http://localhost:8000/docs).

<Callout title="Troubleshooting" intent="info">
    If services don't start correctly, check the logs:
    ```bash
    ./scripts/docker-run.sh logs
    ```
    Look for database connection errors, missing API keys, or build failures. Ensure you edited the `.env` file correctly.
</Callout>

</Steps>

## First Login

1.  Go to the Genbase Studio URL: [`http://localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173).
2.  Use the `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` you configured in the root `.env` file to log in.
3.  You should now have access to the Genbase Studio interface.

## Stopping Genbase

To stop all the running Docker containers managed by the script:

```bash {{ "title": "Terminal" }}
./scripts/docker-run.sh down
```

This will stop and remove the containers, but your data stored in Docker volumes (like the database) will persist.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You have a running Genbase instance. Now you can explore:

*   **[User Guide](/user-guide):** Learn how to navigate the Studio, manage projects and modules, and interact with agents.
*   **[Install a Kit](/user-guide/registry):** Browse the registry (if configured) or manually upload a Kit to start adding capabilities.
*   **[Create a Module](/user-guide/modules/creating):** Instantiate a Kit into a runnable Module within a project.
*   **[Concepts](/concepts):** Dive deeper into the core ideas behind Genbase.
