# Kits and the Registry

**Kits** are the core reusable components in Genbase, packaging AI capabilities. The **Registry** is where these Kits are shared and discovered.

## Kits <BlocksIcon className="inline-block h-5 w-5 align-text-bottom" />

A **Kit** is a self-contained, versioned blueprint for an AI capability. It bundles configuration, code, dependencies, and initial data needed for a specific task or workflow.

*   **Purpose:** Enable modularity and reuse. Experts package complex logic and tools into Kits, allowing others to instantiate them easily.
*   **Contents:**
    *   `kit.yaml`: The manifest defining metadata, dependencies, actions, agents, profiles, environment variables, etc. ([Details](/kit-development/kit-yaml)).
    *   `actions/`: Python code for executable functions ([Actions Concept](/concepts/actions-execution)).
    *   `agents/`: Custom agent logic (optional) ([Agents Concept](/concepts/profiles-agents)).
    *   `instructions/`: Text files (Markdown, plain text, etc.) providing context or guidance.
    *   `workspace/`: Initial files for a Module's workspace.
*   **Identification:** Uniquely identified by `owner`/`id`/`version`.
*   **Usage:** Kits are templates. You instantiate them as **[Modules](/concepts/projects-modules)** to create runnable instances.

## Versioning <GitBranchPlusIcon className="inline-block h-5 w-5 align-text-bottom" />

Kits use **Semantic Versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`)**. This allows you to select specific versions when creating Modules, ensuring consistency and managing updates.

## The Registry <PackageSearchIcon className="inline-block h-5 w-5 align-text-bottom" />

The **Registry** acts as a central repository for Kits. Genbase interacts with a registry service (configured via the `REGISTRY_URL` environment variable) to find and download Kits.

*   **Default Registry:** Genbase defaults to using `registry.genbase.io`, where the community can potentially publish and share Kits.
*   **Custom Registries:** You can configure Genbase to point to a private or alternative registry service, provided it adheres to the expected API structure.
*   **Discovery & Installation:** Use the [Registry Explorer](/user-guide/registry) in Studio or the API to browse the configured registry and install Kits. Installation downloads the Kit to your local Genbase environment (in `KIT_BASE_DIR`), making it available for creating Modules.
*   **Publishing:** To share your own Kits, you would typically package them as `.tar.gz` archives and upload them to a registry service like `registry.genbase.io` (or your configured private registry) through its specific interface. ([See Packaging](/kit-development/packaging-publishing)).

<Callout title="Local Cache">
Installing a Kit downloads it locally. Modules are always created from these local copies, ensuring consistent builds even if the registry becomes unavailable later.

Kits and the Registry work together to create an ecosystem for sharing and composing AI capabilities, promoting reuse and accelerating development.
