# Using the Kit Registry

The **[Kit Registry](/concepts/kits-registry)** is your central hub for discovering and obtaining reusable AI blueprints called **[Kits](/concepts/kits-registry)**. Genbase Studio provides an integrated **Registry Explorer** to browse the configured registry and install Kits into your local environment.

## Accessing the Registry Explorer <PackageSearchIcon className="inline-block h-5 w-5 align-text-bottom" />

1.  **Navigate:** Click the "Registry" icon (<Package className="inline-block h-4 w-4" />) in the far-left navigation sidebar of Genbase Studio.
2.  **View:** The Explorer Panel (left sidebar area) will now display the **Registry Explorer**, listing Kits available in the configured registry (`REGISTRY_URL`).

## Browsing and Searching Kits

*   **Listing:** Kits are listed in the Registry Explorer, typically showing the Kit Name, Owner, Version, and potentially a short description.
*   **Search:** Use the search bar at the top of the Registry Explorer to filter Kits by name, owner, or keywords in their description.
*   **Selection:** Click on a Kit in the Explorer list to view its detailed information in the Main Content Area.

## Viewing Kit Details

When you select a Kit from the Registry Explorer, the Main Content Area displays comprehensive details about it.

This view typically includes:

*   **Header:** Kit Name, Owner, Version, Description, Upload Date.
*   **Version Selector:** A dropdown to view details for different available versions of the *same* Kit (Owner/ID combination).
*   **Install Button:** Allows you to install the currently selected Kit version.
*   **Tabs (Content Varies by Kit):**
    *   **Overview:** General information, dependencies, required environment variables, defined agents, exposed ports.
    *   **Profiles:** Details about each Profile the Kit offers, including the assigned Agent, available Actions, and associated Instructions.
    *   **Workspace:** Lists the initial files and directories included in the Kit's workspace template.
    *   **Provide:** Shows the Actions, Instructions, or Workspace access the Kit is designed to provide to other modules.
    *   **README:** Often displays the content of a README file if included in the Kit, providing developer notes or usage instructions.

<Callout title="Fetching Details">
Viewing Kit details often involves fetching the `kit.yaml` configuration from the registry in the background.

## Installing a Kit <DownloadIcon className="inline-block h-5 w-5 align-text-bottom" />

Installing a Kit downloads it from the Registry and makes it available locally within your Genbase environment, allowing you to create **[Modules](/concepts/projects-modules)** from it.

1.  **Select Kit & Version:** Browse the Registry Explorer and select the desired Kit. Use the version selector in the Main Content Area header to choose the specific version you want to install.
2.  **Click Install:** Click the "Install Kit" button (usually near the version selector).
3.  **Installation Process:** Genbase Engine will download the Kit archive (`.tar.gz`) from the Registry, extract it, validate its `kit.yaml`, and store it locally (typically under `.data/kit/{owner}/{kit_id}/{version}`).
4.  **Feedback:** You should receive a notification (e.g., a toast message) indicating whether the installation was successful or if any errors occurred. The button might show a loading state during installation.

<Callout title="Local Availability">
Once installed, the Kit (at that specific version) will appear in the "Select Module" dropdown when you [create a new Module](/user-guide/modules/creating) within any of your projects.

## Next Steps <LayersIcon className="inline-block h-5 w-5 align-text-bottom" />

After installing the Kits you need:

*   Navigate back to the "Modules" section using the far-left navigation.
*   Select your desired Project.
*   [Create a new Module](/user-guide/modules/creating) using the Kit you just installed.
