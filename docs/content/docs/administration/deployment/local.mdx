# Running Locally (for Development) <LaptopIcon className="inline-block h-5 w-5 align-text-bottom" />

This guide explains how to run the Genbase Engine (backend) and Studio (frontend) directly on your local machine without using Docker containers. This setup is primarily intended for **active development and debugging** of the Genbase codebase itself.

<Callout title="Recommendation" intent="warn" icon={<AlertTriangleIcon />}>
For general use, evaluation, or production, deploying with **[Docker Compose](/docs/administration/deployment/docker)** is strongly recommended due to its consistency and simplified dependency management. Only use this local setup if you need to directly modify and test the Engine or Studio source code.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

You'll need to install and configure several tools manually:

1.  **Python & PDM:**
    *   Install Python (version 3.9+ recommended, check Engine's `pyproject.toml` for specifics).
    *   Install [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/latest/), the Python dependency manager used by the Engine. Follow their official installation instructions.
2.  **Node.js & npm/yarn:**
    *   Install Node.js (LTS version recommended). [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/).
    *   `npm` is included with Node.js. `yarn` can be installed if preferred (`npm install -g yarn`). The Studio project uses `npm` by default (`package.json`).
3.  **PostgreSQL Server:** <DatabaseIcon className="inline-block h-4 w-4 align-text-bottom" />
    *   Install and run a PostgreSQL server locally or have access to one. ([PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)).
    *   You need to create a database, user, and password for Genbase.
4.  **Git:** To clone the repository.

## Setup and Configuration

<Steps>

### 1. Clone the Repository

If you haven't already, clone the Genbase monorepo:

```bash {{ title: "Terminal" }}
git clone <your-genbase-repo-url>
cd genbase
```

### 2. Configure Environment Files

You need to configure `.env` files for the database connection and API keys.

*   **Engine `.env` File (`engine/.env`):**
    *   Navigate to the `engine/` directory.
    *   Copy the template: `cp .env.template .env` (if it exists).
    *   **Edit `engine/.env`:**
        *   **`DATABASE_URL`:** Set this to connect to your *local* or accessible PostgreSQL server. Example: `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://your_db_user:your_db_password@localhost:5432/genbase_db_name` (Replace placeholders).
        *   **LLM/Embedding Keys:** Add necessary `*_API_KEY` values.
        *   **`AUTH_SECRET`:** Set a strong, unique secret.
        *   **`ADMIN_USERNAME`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`:** Credentials for the initial superuser.
        *   `REGISTRY_URL`, `DATA_DIR`: Set as needed, `.data` is a reasonable default for local `DATA_DIR`.

*   **Studio `.env` File (`studio/.env`):**
    *   Navigate to the `studio/` directory.
    *   Copy the template: `cp .env.template .env` (if it exists).
    *   **Edit `studio/.env`:**
        *   **`VITE_ENGINE_URL`:** This *must* point to the URL where your locally running Engine API will be accessible from your browser. Usually, this is `http://localhost:8000`.

### 3. Install Dependencies

*   **Engine (Python):**
    ```bash {{ title: "Terminal - inside engine/ directory" }}
    cd ../engine # Make sure you are in the engine directory
    pdm install
    ```
    *This installs all Python dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml` into a virtual environment managed by PDM.*

*   **Studio (Node.js):**
    ```bash {{ title: "Terminal - inside studio/ directory" }}
    cd ../studio # Make sure you are in the studio directory
    npm install
    ```
    *This installs all Node.js dependencies listed in `package.json`.*

### 4. Initialize Database & Run Migrations

Before starting the Engine for the first time, ensure your PostgreSQL server is running and the database/user specified in `engine/.env` exist. Then, run the database migrations:

```bash {{ title: "Terminal - inside engine/ directory" }}
cd ../engine # Make sure you are in the engine directory
pdm run migrate # This typically executes 'alembic upgrade head'
```
*This command uses PDM to run the `migrate` script defined in `pyproject.toml`, which should apply all necessary database schema changes.*

</Steps>

## Running the Services

You need to run the Engine and Studio in separate terminal windows.

1.  **Start the Engine (Backend):**
    *   Open a terminal window.
    *   Navigate to the `engine/` directory.
    *   Run the start command using PDM:
        ```bash {{ title: "Terminal - inside engine/ directory" }}
        pdm run start # Executes 'uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload' defined in pyproject.toml
        ```
    *   The Engine API should now be running, typically at `http://localhost:8000`.

2.  **Start the Studio (Frontend):**
    *   Open a *second* terminal window.
    *   Navigate to the `studio/` directory.
    *   Run the development server command:
        ```bash {{ title: "Terminal - inside studio/ directory" }}
        npm run dev
        ```
    *   The Studio development server should now be running, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Accessing Genbase

*   Open your web browser and navigate to the Studio URL (usually [`http://localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173)).
*   Log in using the `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` configured in `engine/.env`.

## Stopping the Services

*   Go to each terminal window where a service is running.
*   Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the process.

<Callout title="Using run-local.sh">
The `scripts/run-local.sh` script attempts to automate the startup process described above (steps 3 & 4 of "Running the Services") in a single command and manages background processes. Review the script to understand how it works before using it. You still need to perform the prerequisite installations and configuration steps manually.
