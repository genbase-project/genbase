# Defining Initial Workspace Content <FolderGitIcon className="inline-block h-5 w-5 align-text-bottom" />

When a **[Module](/concepts/projects-modules)** is created from your Kit, it gets its own dedicated **[Workspace](/concepts/workspace-resources)**, which is essentially a Git repository. The initial content of this repository is populated from the files and directories you place inside the `workspace/` folder within your Kit's source structure.

## Purpose of the `workspace/` Directory

*   **Initial State:** Provide default configuration files, templates, initial data sets, or scripts that your Module's **[Actions](/concepts/actions-execution)** or **[Agents](/concepts/profiles-agents)** might need to function correctly from the start.
*   **Templates:** Include template files (e.g., `config.json.template`, `Dockerfile.template`) that Actions might read, modify, and write back into the *Module's* live workspace repository.
*   **Examples:** Provide example input files or data structures.
*   **Scripts:** Include utility scripts that might be executed by an Action.

## Structure and Content

1.  **Location:** Create a directory named `workspace` at the root of your Kit structure.
2.  **Contents:** Place any files or subdirectories you want to be included in the initial Module workspace inside this `workspace/` directory. The directory structure you create here will be mirrored in the Module's Git repository.

**Example Kit Structure showing `workspace/`:**

<Files>
  <Folder name="my-data-processor-kit" defaultOpen>
    <File name="kit.yaml" />
    <Folder name="actions">
      <File name="processor.py" />
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="workspace" defaultOpen> {/* Initial content defined here */}
       <File name="config.json" />
       <File name=".gitattributes" /> {/* Example: Ensure line endings */}
       <Folder name="input_schemas">
         <File name="event_schema.json" />
       </Folder>
       <Folder name="scripts">
         <File name="validate_input.py" />
       </Folder>
    </Folder>
    <File name="requirements.txt" />
  </Folder>
</Files>

When a Module is created from `my-data-processor-kit`, its workspace repository (`.data/repositories/{module_id}`) will initially contain:

*   `config.json`
*   `.gitattributes`
*   `input_schemas/event_schema.json`
*   `scripts/validate_input.py`
*   A `.gitignore` file (potentially, based on `kit.yaml` settings)

## Referencing Workspace Files in `kit.yaml`

While placing files in `workspace/` copies them initially, you can optionally reference specific files or directories within the `workspace.files` list in your `kit.yaml`. This primarily serves documentation and discoverability purposes (e.g., allowing the `ResourceService` to easily list these specific files via the API, which Studio might use).

```yaml
# kit.yaml (snippet)

workspace:
  files: # List specific files/dirs for documentation/API access
    - path: "config.json"
      description: "Main configuration file for the data processor."
    - path: "input_schemas/"
      description: "Directory containing JSON schemas for input validation."
    - path: "scripts/validate_input.py"
      description: "Script used by the 'validate' action."

  ignore: # Patterns for the Module's .gitignore
    - "*.log"
    - "output/"
    - ".DS_Store"
```

*   **`workspace.files`:** List of objects describing key initial files/dirs.
    *   `path`: Path relative to the `workspace/` directory in your Kit source (and thus relative to the root of the Module's repo).
    *   `description`: Explains the purpose of the file/directory.
*   **`workspace.ignore`:** List of patterns added to the `.gitignore` file created in the Module's repository, helping keep it clean from logs, temporary files, etc.

<Callout title="Initial Copy vs. Live Files">
Remember that the `workspace/` directory in your Kit source only defines the *initial* state. Once a Module is created, its workspace repository is independent. Changes made by Actions within a running Module *do not* affect the Kit's source `workspace/` directory or other Modules created from the same Kit.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

*   **Keep it Minimal:** Only include files essential for the Module's initial operation or commonly needed templates. Avoid large datasets or binaries if possible.
*   **Use Templates:** If configuration needs to be customized per-module, provide template files (e.g., `config.template.json`) and have an initialization Action read the template, modify it (perhaps with environment variables), and write the final `config.json`.
*   **Consider `.gitignore`:** Use the `workspace.ignore` setting in `kit.yaml` or include a `.gitignore` file directly in your `workspace/` directory to prevent common unwanted files (logs, caches, OS files) from being accidentally committed by Actions.
*   **Document Key Files:** Use the `workspace.files` list in `kit.yaml` to document the purpose of important initial files.

By carefully defining the initial workspace content, you ensure that Modules created from your Kit start in a consistent and functional state.
