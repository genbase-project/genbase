Welcome to the Kit Developer Guide! This section provides the information you need to create your own reusable AI capabilities as Genbase **[Kits](/concepts/kits-registry)**.

## The Power of Kits <PuzzleIcon className="inline-block h-5 w-5 align-text-bottom" />

Kits are the cornerstone of Genbase's modularity. By packaging specific functionalities, expertise, and workflows into a standardized format, Kits enable:

*   **Reusability:** Build a capability once (like managing a specific database or interacting with an external API) and reuse it across multiple projects and modules.
*   **Specialization:** Focus a Kit on solving one problem domain exceptionally well, incorporating best practices and tailored logic.
*   **Collaboration:** Share your Kits via a **[Registry](/concepts/kits-registry)**, allowing others to benefit from your work and build upon it.
*   **Composition:** Construct complex AI systems by assembling and connecting Modules instantiated from different specialized Kits.
*   **Standardization:** Provide a common structure (`kit.yaml`, standard directories) for defining and understanding AI capabilities.

## What Makes a Good Kit?

When designing a Kit, consider these principles:

1.  **Clear Purpose:** Define a specific problem or capability the Kit addresses (e.g., "PostgreSQL Schema Management," "React Component Generation," "Web Content Summarization").
2.  **Well-Defined Interface:** Expose functionality through clear **[Profiles](/concepts/profiles-agents)** and well-documented **[Tools](/concepts/tools-execution)**. Think about how other modules or users will interact with it.
3.  **Encapsulation:** Keep internal logic hidden where possible. Expose necessary functionality via Tools and manage internal state within the Module's **[Workspace](/concepts/workspace-resources)** or Profile Store.
4.  **Configuration:** Use environment variables (defined in `kit.yaml`) for necessary external configurations (API keys, connection strings). Provide sensible defaults where possible.
5.  **Reusability:** Design Tools and logic to be generally applicable within the Kit's domain, avoiding hardcoding project-specific details.
6.  **Resource Sharing (Provide):** Clearly define what the Kit *provides* (`provide` section in `kit.yaml`) if it's intended to share functionality (Tools) or data (Workspace) with other Modules.
7.  **Documentation:** Include clear descriptions in `kit.yaml` and potentially a `README.md` within the Kit explaining its purpose, usage, and configuration.

<Callout title="Think Modularly">
Avoid creating monolithic Kits that try to do everything. Instead, break down complex problems into smaller, composable Kits that can work together through defined interfaces (Profiles, Tools, Provide).

## Development Workflow Overview <RocketIcon className="inline-block h-5 w-5 align-text-bottom" />

Developing a Kit typically involves:

1.  **Planning:** Define the Kit's purpose, inputs, outputs, tools, and configuration.
2.  **Structuring:** Set up the standard Kit directory structure. ([See Structure](/kit-development/structure))
3.  **Defining the Manifest:** Create and populate the `kit.yaml` file. ([See kit.yaml Reference](/kit-development/kit-yaml))
4.  **Implementing Tools:** Write the core Python logic in the `tools/` directory. ([See Tools](/kit-development/tools))
5.  **(Optional) Implementing Agents:** Create custom agent logic if needed. ([See Agents](/kit-development/agents))
6.  **Defining Profiles:** Link agents and tools for specific interaction modes in `kit.yaml`. ([See Profiles](/kit-development/profiles))
7.  **Adding Instructions:** Write relevant Markdown guides. ([See Instructions](/kit-development/instructions))
8.  **Configuring Workspace:** Add necessary initial files to the `workspace/` directory. ([See Workspace](/kit-development/workspace))
9.  **Defining Provisions:** Specify shared resources in the `provide` section. ([See Providing Resources](/kit-development/providing-resources))
10. **Packaging:** Create the `.tar.gz` archive. ([See Packaging](/kit-development/packaging-publishing))
11. **Testing:** Install the Kit locally, create a Module, and test its Profiles and Tools thoroughly.
12. **Publishing (Optional):** Upload the Kit package to a registry.
