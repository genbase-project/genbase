# Genbase Studio User Guide

Welcome to the Genbase Studio! This guide will help you understand the different parts of the user interface and how to perform common tasks like managing your projects, modules, and interacting with AI agents.

## Overview <LayoutDashboardIcon className="inline-block h-5 w-5 align-text-bottom" />

Genbase Studio provides a visual interface for interacting with the Genbase Engine backend. It allows you to:

*   Organize your work into **Projects**.
*   Browse and manage reusable **Kits** via the **Registry**.
*   Create and configure **Modules** (instances of Kits).
*   Interact with Modules via **Profiles** using a **Chat** interface.
*   View and manage Module **Workspaces** and **Resources**.
*   Define **Relationships** and **Resource Sharing** between Modules.
*   Configure system **Settings** (like the default LLM).
*   **(Admins Only)** Manage **Users** and access control.

## Main Interface Layout

The Studio interface is typically divided into several key areas:

*(Image: Screenshot of the main Studio interface with key areas highlighted: 1. Sidebar Navigation, 2. Explorer Panel (Modules/Registry/Settings), 3. Main Content Area, 4. Bottom Chat/Interaction Panel)*

1.  **Sidebar Navigation (Far Left):** Allows switching between major sections like Modules, Registry, Users (Admin), and Settings.
2.  **Explorer Panel (Left):** Context-sensitive sidebar showing relevant items for the selected section (e.g., Module tree, Registry Kits, Settings options). This panel can usually be collapsed/expanded.
3.  **Main Content Area (Center):** Displays detailed information or interfaces based on selections in the Explorer Panel (e.g., Module workspace files, Kit details, Settings forms).
4.  **Bottom Panel (Bottom/Chat):** Primarily used for interacting with selected Modules via their Profiles through a chat interface. This panel can often be resized or maximized.
