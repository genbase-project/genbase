# Core Concepts

Welcome to the conceptual overview of Genbase. Understanding these core ideas is essential for effectively using the platform, whether you're operating modules, developing kits, or administering the system.

Genbase is built around a modular architecture designed for creating, managing, and orchestrating complex AI agent systems. Each concept represents a key building block in this architecture.

## Key Building Blocks

Explore these concepts to grasp how Genbase structures AI development and collaboration:
