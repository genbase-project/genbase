# Deployment Options

This section outlines the different ways you can deploy and run the Genbase platform, consisting of the **Engine** (FastAPI backend) and the **Studio** (React frontend), along with its required **PostgreSQL** database.

## Recommended Method: Docker Compose

Using Docker and Docker Compose is the **highly recommended** method for deploying Genbase, especially for development, testing, and production environments.

*   **Consistency:** Provides a consistent environment across different machines.
*   **Isolation:** Services run in isolated containers, preventing dependency conflicts.
*   **Simplified Setup:** Manages the database, backend, and frontend services with simple commands.
*   **Scalability Foundation:** Easier to scale components independently later if needed.

## Alternative Method: Local Development Setup

Running the services directly on your local machine is primarily intended for **active development and debugging** of the Engine or Studio codebases.

*   **Prerequisites:** Requires manual installation of Python (with PDM), Node.js (with npm/yarn), and a running PostgreSQL server on your host machine.
*   **Complexity:** Managing dependencies, environment variables, and service startup order is more complex than using Docker.
*   **Potential Conflicts:** Higher chance of conflicts with other software or libraries on your system.

For most users wanting to *use* or *evaluate* Genbase, **Docker Compose is the easiest and most reliable way to get started.** Choose the local setup only if you intend to actively modify the core Engine or Studio source code.
