# Providing Resources to Other Modules <Share2Icon className="inline-block h-5 w-5 align-text-bottom" />

A key feature of Genbase is the ability for **[Modules](/concepts/projects-modules)** to collaborate by sharing resources. As a Kit developer, you define *what* your Kit is capable of sharing in the `provide` section of your `kit.yaml`. This allows Modules created from your Kit to grant specific capabilities or data access to other Modules. ([See Provide Concept](/concepts/relationships-provide)).

## The `provide` Section in `kit.yaml`

The optional top-level `provide` key in `kit.yaml` is where you declare the resources your Kit makes available for sharing.

```yaml
# kit.yaml (snippet)

# ... (id, version, name, owner, etc.)

provide:
  # --- Tools shared by this Kit ---
  tools:
    - name: "lookup_user_id" # Name the consuming agent will use
      path: "user_service:get_id_by_email" # Function in tools/user_service.py
      description: "Looks up a user ID based on their email address."
    - name: "validate_token"
      path: "auth:verify_token" # Function in tools/auth.py
      description: "Validates an authentication token."

  # --- Instructions shared by this Kit ---
  instructions:
    - name: "api_guidelines"
      path: "guides/provider_api_usage.md" # File in instructions/guides/
      description: "Best practices for interacting with this Kit's provided tools."

  # --- Workspace sharing declaration ---
  workspace:
    description: "Provides read-only access to the user data cache files."
    # Note: No 'files' list here; providing workspace grants access to the whole repo.
```

## Definable Resources

You can define the following under the `provide` key:

1.  **`tools`** <ZapIcon className="inline-block h-4 w-4 align-text-bottom" /> (Optional, List of Objects):
    *   Declares **[Kit Tools](/concepts/tools-execution)** that consuming Modules can invoke.
    *   The structure for each tool (`name`, `path`, `description`) is identical to defining tools within `profiles`.
    *   **Crucially:** When a consuming Module's Agent calls a provided tool, the tool code executes in an isolated Docker container using the **Provider Module's** environment variables, dependencies, and workspace context. Only the result is returned to the consuming Agent.

2.  **`instructions`** <FileTextIcon className="inline-block h-4 w-4 align-text-bottom" /> (Optional, List of Objects):
    *   Declares **[Instruction Files](/kit-development/instructions)** that provide context about the shared resources.
    *   The structure (`name`, `path`, `description`) is identical to defining instructions within `profiles`.
    *   This information can be made available to the *consuming* Module's Agent to help it understand how to use the provided Tools or interpret the provided Workspace content.

3.  **`workspace`** <FolderGitIcon className="inline-block h-4 w-4 align-text-bottom" /> (Optional, Object):
    *   If this object exists (even if empty, `{}`), it signifies that Modules created from this Kit *can* share their entire **[Workspace](/concepts/workspace-resources)**.
    *   When Module A provides its workspace to Module B, Module A's Git repository is added as a **read-only Git submodule** inside Module B's repository, typically at `/repo/workspaces/{module_a_id}/`.
    *   `description`: (Optional, String) Briefly describes the purpose or content of the shared workspace.

## How Consumers Use Provided Resources

*   **Establishing the Link:** A user or administrator must explicitly create the `ModuleProvide` link between two running Module instances using the Studio UI ([Managing Provisions](/user-guide/modules/providing)) or the API. Simply defining resources in `provide` doesn't automatically link modules.
*   **Consuming Tools:** Once Module A provides an Tool (e.g., `lookup_user_id`) to Module B, that tool name becomes available as a potential tool call for Module B's Agent when it interacts with its Profiles. The Agent's `set_context` method (potentially via `IncludeOptions(provided_tools=True)`) can be configured to include these provided tools in the list of tools passed to the LLM.
*   **Consuming Workspace:** Once Module A provides its Workspace to Module B, any Tool executed by Module B can access the files within Module A's workspace by reading from the path `/repo/workspaces/{module_a_id}/...` inside its Docker execution container.
*   **Consuming Instructions:** Instructions defined in the `provide` section of Module A's Kit can be included in the `profile_data.instructions` list passed to Module B's Agent, providing context on how to use Module A's provided resources.

<Callout title="Design Considerations">
*   Only `provide` Tools and Instructions that make sense for external consumption. Keep internal helper functions private.
*   Ensure provided Tools have clear descriptions for the consuming LLM/Agent.
*   Document the purpose and structure of a provided Workspace clearly in the `provide.workspace.description` or a README.
*   Remember that provided Tools execute within the *Provider's* context â€“ they have access to the Provider's environment variables and workspace, not the Consumer's.
</Callout>

Defining resources in the `provide` section is how you turn your Kit from a standalone capability into a collaborative component within the larger Genbase ecosystem.
