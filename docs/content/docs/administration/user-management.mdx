# User Management <UsersIcon className="inline-block h-5 w-5 align-text-bottom" />

Genbase includes a user management system allowing administrators (Superusers) to create, view, modify, and delete user accounts directly within the Genbase Studio interface.

<Callout title="Permissions Required" intent="warn" icon={<ShieldCheckIcon />}>
    Accessing the User Management page and performing user administration tasks requires **Superuser** privileges. Regular users will not see the "Users & Access" section in the navigation sidebar.
</Callout>

## Accessing User Management

1.  **Navigate:** As a logged-in Superuser, click the "Users & Access" icon (<UsersIcon className="inline-block h-4 w-4" />) in the far-left navigation sidebar.
2.  **Select Users:** In the Explorer panel that appears, click on "Users".
3.  **View:** The Main Content Area will display the User Management page, listing all registered users.

## Viewing Users

The main table displays key information about each user:

*   **Email:** The user's login email address.
*   **Status:** Indicates if the account is `Active` (can log in) or `Inactive` (cannot log in).
*   **Role:** Shows whether the user is a regular `User` or a `Superuser`.
*   **Tools:** Buttons to edit or delete the user.

## Creating a New User <PlusCircleIcon className="inline-block h-5 w-5 align-text-bottom" />

1.  **Open Dialog:** Click the "Create User" button located at the top-right of the user table header.
2.  **Fill Details:** A dialog box will appear.
    *   Enter the new user's **Email** address.
    *   Enter a strong initial **Password**. The user should change this upon first login if possible (or use the password reset feature).
    *   **(Optional)** Use the checkboxes to set the initial **Active** status and **Superuser** role. By default, users are created as Active and non-Superuser.

3.  **Confirm:** Click the "Create User" button in the dialog.
4.  **Feedback:** A notification will confirm success or failure. The user list will update automatically.

<Callout title="Password Security" >
It's recommended to use a strong, randomly generated initial password and instruct the new user to change it immediately using the [Password & Security](/docs/administration/security) settings page after they log in.
</Callout>

## Editing a User <EditIcon className="inline-block h-5 w-5 align-text-bottom" />

Superusers can modify existing user accounts.

1.  **Locate User:** Find the user you want to edit in the user table.
2.  **Open Dialog:** Click the Edit icon (<EditIcon className="inline-block h-4 w-4" />) in the "Tools" column for that user.
3.  **Modify Details:** An "Edit User" dialog will appear. You can typically change:
    *   **Email:** Update the user's email address.
    *   **New Password (Optional):** Enter a new password *only if you want to reset it*. Leave blank to keep the current password unchanged.
    *   **Active Status:** Use the switch/checkbox to activate or deactivate the account.
    *   **Superuser Role:** Use the switch/checkbox to grant or revoke Superuser privileges.

4.  **Save Changes:** Click the "Save Changes" button.
5.  **Feedback:** A notification will confirm the update. The user list will refresh.

## Deleting a User <Trash2Icon className="inline-block h-5 w-5 align-text-bottom text-destructive" />

Deleting a user permanently removes their account and access.

1.  **Locate User:** Find the user you want to delete in the table.
2.  **Initiate Deletion:** Click the Delete icon (<Trash2Icon className="inline-block h-4 w-4" />) in the "Tools" column.
3.  **Confirm:** An alert dialog will appear, warning you that the tool is irreversible. Read the warning carefully.
4.  **Confirm Tool:** Click the "Delete User" (or similarly labeled confirmation) button, often styled distinctively (e.g., red).

    *(Image: Screenshot of the confirmation dialog shown before deleting a user, emphasizing the permanent nature of the tool.)*

5.  **Feedback:** A notification will confirm the deletion. The user will be removed from the list.

<Callout title="Caution: Deletion" intent="danger">
Deleting a user is permanent and cannot be undone. Ensure you are deleting the correct account. You typically cannot delete your own superuser account while logged in with it.
