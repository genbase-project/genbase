[request_definition]
# sub: subject (user requesting access)
# obj: object (resource being accessed)
# act: action (operation being performed)

[policy_definition]
# Defines the structure of a policy rule
# sub: role or user ID
# obj: resource identifier
# act: action allowed
p = sub, obj, act

[role_definition]
# Defines role hierarchy/grouping
# g = user, role  (User inherits Role)

[policy_effect]
# Defines how policy decisions are combined
# e = allow-override: if any matching policy allows, the result is allow.

[matchers]
# Defines how requests are matched against policies
m = g(r.sub, p.sub) && r.obj == p.obj && r.act == p.act
# Breakdown:
# g(r.sub, p.sub): Check if the requesting user (r.sub) has the role (p.sub) defined in the policy (handles role inheritance).
# r.obj == p.obj: Check if the requested resource object exactly matches the object in the policy.
# r.act == p.act: Check if the requested action exactly matches the action in the policy.
