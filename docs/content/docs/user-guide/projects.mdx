# Managing Projects

**[Projects](/concepts/projects-modules)** are the top-level containers for organizing your work in Genbase. All **[Modules](/concepts/projects-modules)** belong to a specific Project. Genbase Studio provides a simple way to switch between existing projects and create new ones.

## Selecting the Active Project <FolderGit2Icon className="inline-block h-5 w-5 align-text-bottom" />

The currently active project determines which set of Modules are displayed in the Module Explorer. You can select the active project using the **Project Selector** dropdown located near the top of the Module Explorer sidebar.

*(Image: Screenshot of the Project Selector dropdown in the Studio sidebar, highlighting an active project.)*

1.  **Locate the Selector:** Find the dropdown menu labeled "Project:" in the sidebar (usually visible when the "Modules" tab is selected in the far-left navigation).
2.  **Click the Dropdown:** Click on the selector to reveal the list of available projects.
3.  **Choose a Project:** Select the desired project name from the list.
4.  **View Updates:** The Module Explorer tree will automatically update to show the Modules belonging to the selected project.

<Callout title="Default Project">
If you haven't created any projects yet, you'll likely only see the `default` project (ID: `0000...`). Modules created without specifying a project are typically assigned here.
</Callout>

## Creating a New Project <PlusCircleIcon className="inline-block h-5 w-5 align-text-bottom" />

You can easily create new projects directly from the Project Selector.

1.  **Open the Selector:** Click the Project Selector dropdown in the sidebar.
2.  **Choose "Create New Project":** Select the option typically found at the bottom of the project list, often marked with a plus icon.
3.  **Enter Name:** A dialog box will appear prompting you to enter a name for your new project. Choose a descriptive name.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
    <img src="/images/studio-create-project-dialog.png" alt="Create Project Dialog" style={{ maxWidth: '80%' }} />
    <p>*(Image: Screenshot of the "Create New Project" dialog box asking for the project name.)*</p>
</div>

4.  **Confirm:** Click the "Create Project" (or similar) button in the dialog.
5.  **Auto-Select:** Genbase will create the project, and it will usually become the newly selected active project automatically. The Module Explorer will be empty initially for this new project.

You can now start [creating Modules](/user-guide/modules/creating) within your newly created project.
